This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom camera controls.  The issue is that when the camera is initially mounted, the preview might not render correctly, appearing black or showing a distorted image. This is particularly noticeable when using the `onCameraReady` prop in conjunction with other UI elements.  This seems tied to asynchronous operations where the preview is initialized before camera configurations are fully applied.
